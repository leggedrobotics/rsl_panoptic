# Model Zoo and Baselines

## Introduction
This guide presents our Model Zoo, designed for construction site applications, featuring models trained on construction site datasets. These models are optimized for single GPU use in supervised training.

### Pre-trained Models and Fine-tuned Variants

We offer original and fine-tuned models for construction site monitoring tasks like object detection and segmentation. Models are available for download via Google Drive.
